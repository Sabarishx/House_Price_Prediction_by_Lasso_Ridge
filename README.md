# House Price Prediction by Lasso Ridge

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Lasso and Ridge regression algorithms. Lasso and Ridge regression are two types of regularized linear regression algorithms that can be used to improve the performance and interpretability of linear regression models.

The Lasso algorithm performs L1 regularization, which shrinks the coefficients of less important features towards zero. This can help to reduce overfitting and improve the interpretability of the model. The Ridge algorithm performs L2 regularization, which shrinks all of the coefficients towards zero. This can help to improve the stability of the model and reduce overfitting.

This repository includes a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to use the Lasso and Ridge regression algorithms to predict house prices. The notebook also includes a comparison of the performance of the two algorithms on a real-world dataset.
